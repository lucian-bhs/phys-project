**Research Question & Response:** How are (the concepts we learned in class) being used in real-world experiments today?

I chose this topic because I thought it would be really useful to be able to get an idea of what is actually going on to utilize these concepts beyond what we see in our everyday lives. It's also been something I've always been interested in so being able to do a project on connecting the two was just something I thought would be fun to research.

What I found out is that, albeit way more complicated and in-depth than we've learned in class at this level, these experiments do at a fundamental use the same concepts we've learned. Now, I wasn't able to find any specific examples of static electricity being used in these massive experiments like I could magnetism, light waves and current but we can see the functional uses of those in our everyday lives - like fridge magnets, MRIs, etc. Same with sound waves, being fundamental in our species in that we use it to communicate and being a source of enjoyment for many through the form of music. Anywhere you look you'll find these things being used and I think it's extremely useful to be able to see how they function to get a better understanding of the world. These specific experiments may not give you a better understanding of the world but they do at least showcase how they're being used to do some pretty crazy stuff outside of just lightbulbs and fridge magnets.
