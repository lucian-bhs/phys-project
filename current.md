# Current Electricity

### Phenomenon

When a battery is attached to a lightbulb, the lightbulb lights up.

### Mechanism

Potential energy moves from a source (in this case stored in the battery) through a closed circuit and in the lightbulb turns this potential energy into light energy.

### Mechanistic Model

A circuit needs to be a closed loop (closed circuit) to work. Unlike magnetism, polarity is shown as positive and negative with energy traveling in the negative direction from the source.
Voltage is the potential difference, or the actual energy in the circuit whereas current is the "flow rate" at which it moves. Resistance (ohms) is the measure of how difficult it is for current electricity to pass through a conductor.

Ohm's law can be used to calculate any value in this system as long as you already know 2 others.

Current = Voltage / Resistance, or I=V/R

Voltage = Current * Resistance, or V=IR

Resistance = Voltage / Current, or R=V/I


* I couldn't think of a good phenomenon for this so I used a very specific example from an experiment, hopefully that works!
