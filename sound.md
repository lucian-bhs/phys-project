# Sound Waves

### Phenomenon

We hear sounds. *Woah.*

### Mechanism

Sound is emitted from a source through vibrations that propogate in a medium. This disturbance in said medium can travel to the listener either directly or being bounced off surfaces and is then observable.

### Mechanistic Model

Sound is a *longitudinal* wave. Amplitude determines volume and wavelength determines the audible frequency in this instance.

This can be compared to a slinky when it's moved and vibrations propogate across it. Amplitude on a longitudinal wave diagram is shown through density and wavelength is shown through the frequency in which these compressions are drawn.

A *disturbance* is, in a longitudinal wave, a dense portion of energy (like a lot of dots in one area).

Sound waves travel best through solid objects, becoming more difficult as the density is lowered into liquids and gases. Sound cannot travel through space because it requires a medium.
