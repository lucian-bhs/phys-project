# Magnetism

### Phenomenon

Certain objects attract/repel each other from a distance.

### Mechanism

Magnetic objects can attract or repel based on their poles (N/S) through magnetic domains spread out inside them. The magnetic field of magnets can affect each other, as well as ferromagnetic objects.

### Mechanistic Model

Ferromagnetic objects are objects that can be influenced by magnets. They all contain magnetic domains which spin either north or south. The net alignment of these domains determine if the object attracts or repels (but only in a magnet).

Magnetism is a force at a distance and can occur even *through* certain objects that don't interfere with the magnetic field.
