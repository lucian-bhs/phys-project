# Light Waves

### Phenomenon

Light illuminates the area around the source and allows us to see things.

### Mechanism

Light waves travel from a source of the emission to the area around it in the form of light energy, and can travel without the use of a medium. In contrast to sound, light has a harder time travelling through denser materials with solid materials like a wall being almost impossible for visible light to get through.

### Mechanistic Model

Light waves are a *transverse* wave that measure amplitude in peaks and troughs. In a light wave, wavelength will determine the color of the light and the amplitude will determine brightness.
