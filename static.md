# Static Electricity

### Phenomenon

When certain objects are rubbed together, they begin to attract or repel.

### Mechanism

When objects that tend to gain negative charges rub onto objects that tend to lose them, they begin to attract to each other (and vice versa) through energy transferred during friction.

### Mechanistic Model

The Triboelectric Series states which objects tend to gain or lose negative charges.

Through this, we can determine which objects will attract or repel when rubbed together. Friction between these objects causes a transfer of energy to occur, and the resulting energy is what causes this attraction or repulsion.

Like charges repel and opposite charges attract, and the net charge inside an insulator will change how it interacts with others based on the movement of negative charges (positive charges do not move).
