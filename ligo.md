Remember that light waves have peaks and troughs, as such:

And with that in mind, when two lasers converge at one point, their waves will interfere with each other based on their conflicting amplitudes (intensity/brightness). If the peaks of both lasers overlapped, nothing would happen since the amplitude is equal at said point. But, in LIGO's case, the lasers are fired in such a way that the peak of one laser and the troughs of another overlaps, _they cancel each other out_.
