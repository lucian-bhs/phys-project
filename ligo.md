**LIGO**, or it's more confusing name "Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory", is a physics experiment and observatory with two measurement sites. One site is in Hanford, Washington while another is in Livingston, Louisiana. Both locations involve two 2 1/2 mile long vaccuum tubes forming an L shape.

LIGO's goal is to measure "gravitational waves", distortions in space caused by massive masses like stars in distant galaxies. They can be measured by the equipment in the facility, which involves a lot of very complex scientific concepts (that we won't exactly go into here).

Remember that light waves have peaks and troughs, as such:

And with that in mind, when two lasers converge at one point, their waves will interfere with each other based on their conflicting amplitudes (intensity/brightness). If the peaks of both lasers overlapped, nothing would happen since the amplitude is equal at said point. But, in LIGO's case, the lasers are fired in such a way that the peak of one laser and the troughs of another overlaps, _they cancel each other out_.

The interference of these lasers is the primary concept that allows LIGO to work. The main structure of both sites themselves are stationed on huge hydraulic stabilizers in remote locations with little noise to prevent these lasers from shaking or moving much at all, as well as electromagnets on the mirrors that reflect their light to even further stabilize them. A laser is fired into a beam splitter that takes it along the length of the tube so that when they reflect back to the detector, their beams are offset just enough to interfere equally.



*But how do they detect these "gravitational waves"?

A gravitational wave is a complicated concept so the basic idea to understand from it is that it's a huge wave that exists as a disturbance in space, travelling at the speed of light. When these gravitational waves pass through the Earth, they create a disturbance in everything they pass through that's so tiny it's unnoticable by anything - except the detectors. The distance of the lasers apart and the stabilization techniques they use allow them to be incredibly sensitive, being the only known thing on Earth able to measure these waves. The wave causes  The measurement of gravitational waves allows us to get a better idea of how black holes work and the energy released by supernovae (dying, exploding stars).

### Base Concept

The basic concept to take away from this example is the structure of a light wave: A transverse wave in which amplitude determines brightness/energy and wavelength determines color. As well as this, light waves intersecting at a point can interfere with each other.
