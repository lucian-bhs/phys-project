**LIGO**, or it's more confusing name "Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory", is a physics experiment and observatory with two measurement sites. One site is in Hanford, Washington while another is in Livingston, Louisiana. Both locations involve two 2 1/2 mile long vaccuum tubes forming an L shape.

LIGO's goal is to measure "gravitational waves", distortions in space caused by massive masses like stars in distant galaxies. They can be measured by the equipment in the facility, which involves a lot of very complex scientific concepts (that we won't exactly go into here).

Remember that light waves have peaks and troughs, as such:

And with that in mind, when two lasers converge at one point, their waves will interfere with each other based on their conflicting amplitudes (intensity/brightness). If the peak of one laser and the trough of another overlapped, nothing would happen since the amplitude is equal on average at that point. These overlapping beams are timed in a way so that they are *always* overlapping like this, and so when a vibration hits the complex it allows the lasers to shake and go out of alignment temporarily. The detectors can then measure this misalignment.

The interference of these lasers is the primary concept that allows LIGO to work. The main structure of both sites themselves are stationed on huge hydraulic stabilizers in remote locations with little noise to prevent these lasers from shaking or moving much at all, as well as electromagnets on the mirrors that reflect their light that move in response to measurement devices on-site. A laser is fired into a beam splitter that takes it along the length of the tubes so that when they reflect back to the detector, their beams are offset just enough to interfere equally.

The reason there are two facilities spaced such a distance apart is to be able to cross-check and compare data. This is the same type of concept that is used in astronomy in regards to space telescopes, as many sites will contain as much as ~30 radio telescopes that all collect data simultaneously to both widen the distance at which they collect data, and to confirm that the data that was recieved is valid. If one of LIGO's detectors recieves data on a wave, but another doesn't, they know that data was probably inaccurate and caused due to vibrations around the area. The wavelength of gravitational waves usually span large distances, covering anywhere from 5 to 60 miles.

*But how do they detect these "gravitational waves"?

A gravitational wave is a complicated concept so the basic idea to understand from it is that it's a huge wave that exists as a disturbance in space, travelling at the speed of light. When these gravitational waves pass through the Earth, they create a disturbance in everything they pass through that's so tiny it's unnoticable by anything - except the detectors. The distance of the lasers apart and the stabilization techniques they use allow them to be incredibly sensitive, which is what gives these facilities this unique job. The wave causes  The measurement of gravitational waves allows us to get a better idea of how black holes work and the energy released by supernovae (dying, exploding stars).

### Base Concept

The basic concept to take away from this example is the structure of a light wave: A transverse wave in which amplitude determines brightness/energy and wavelength determines color. As well as this, light waves intersecting at a point can interfere with each other. These concepts are the fundamental physical ideas that allow LIGO to work.
