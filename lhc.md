The **LHC**, or the Large Hadron Collider (an experiment as a part of CERN), aims to research new particles and fields of energy sciences through massive rings of vaccuum tubes to accelerate particles to near light speed and smash together. This is done through the complex systems in place at the facility, and involve both magnetism and current electricity.

Inside this loop, there are accelerators placed evenly to speed up the particles that will be tested on through the use of a magnetic field. Each accelerator is basically a massive electromagnet that, through the concepts of magnetism (like poles repel, opposite poles attract) push the particles away through the loop to reach these needed speeds.

But this is a bunch of energy that needs to be dispersed across the length of the loop, and there needs to be a *lot* of it. So, well... *how?*.

### Electrical Systems

The electrical systems in the LHC are designed in a way that electricity is handled precisely and accurately across the entire facility as to prevent any malfunction. First off, they don't use conventional copper cables to transmit energy. That would offer too much resistance and massively increase the electricty needed to allow the system to work (at peak operation, the building uses up to 200 MW of power - a third of the nearby city of Geneva). They use a niobium-titanium alloy that, when cooled to near absolute zero, can be up to 100 times more conductive than conventional copper.

This added efficiency helps keep energy usage down as much as possible and improves the reliability of the whole system.

Second off, how electricity arrives in the first place. From the grid, electricity arrives at the facility at 400 kV, or 400,000 volts. That's quite a bit, and needs to be lowered before being used on the laboratory's electrical equipment. For this, massive "*step-down transformers*" are used.

These transformers lower the 400 kV down to 66 or 18 kV, the operating level of most equipment on site. This is done through a complex phenomenon called the "magnetic induction principle". In basic terms, it uses magnetic fields and a magnetic core (usually iron) to allow the voltage to be stepped down to a needed level.

These systems combined with all of the other equipment on-site at the LHC allow them to conduct frequent experiments that give us data on how the universe started, and have even shown us new previously undiscovered particles before.
