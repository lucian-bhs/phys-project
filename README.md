## Real World, Large-Scale Experiments

These pages will go through how the science concepts we all learned in class apply to real-world experiments being conducted by scientists right now! The two large ones that will be referenced here both have to do with physics - LIGO and the LHC.

### What Are Those?

**LIGO**, or it's more confusing name "Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory", is a physics experiment and observatory with two measurement sites. One site is in Hanford, Washington while another is in Livingston, Louisiana. Both locations involve two 2 1/2 mile long vaccuum tubes forming an L shape.

LIGO's goal is to measure "gravitational waves", distortions in space caused by massive masses like stars in distant galaxies. They can be measured by the equipment in the facility, which involves a lot of very complex scientific concepts (that we won't exactly go into here).

**LHC**, or the Large Hadron Collider, is also a large-scale physics project but it aims to accomplish different goals. It actively fires particles in a vaccuum chamber at near the speed of light before smashing them together. This allows them to measure tons of data with the LHC's specialized detectors to learn more about physics.

This vaccuum tube is in a loop almost 17 miles long, and contains superconducting magnets along the length of the tunnel to accelerate the particles to incredible speeds.
